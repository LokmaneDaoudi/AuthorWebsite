            <h1>about me</h1>
                he was born on June 2nd 1999. Before making his debut novel, lokmane obtained his professional Bachelor's degree (licence) in mining engineering from the university of badji-moukhtar in his home town, Annaba.
            </p>

            <p>like many authors, lokmane started his journey in storytelling since he was young where he started by scribbling and illustrating. He later started making writing prompts and diaries which he dropped after reading his first book by agatha christie "the pale horse", which inspired him to read more and sharpen his language to improve his skills.
            </p>

            <p>after that break he went back to his writing prompts, this time with more passion. He kept writing and reading at the same time, and afterwards he came upon a book titled "the alchemist" by paolo coelho, which he still considers the best book that has ever existed. And this was the beginning of him starting storytelling on the right track.
            </p>

            <p>
                lokmane writes fiction, and also likes to program and design. when he is not writing, he is either watching movies and tv shows or hanging out with friends.
